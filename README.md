# Description
Windows Driver Auto Installer. This script is for going through all the folders of exported drivers and auto running the installation files.

# Not Working?
If this script isn't working, you need to find the directory to PNPUTIL.exe on your Windows OS drive and replace the directory in the `os.system()` parameters with it.
